A caveat of TWIMS devices is\nthat each instrument must be calibrated with ions of known\nmobility prior to calculating CCS values of unknowns\n(analogous to the single-field method in DTIMS). Histori-\ncally, polyalanine has been utilized for CCS calibration in\nTWIMS, although the specific compounds best suited for\nthis purpose are still heavily debated in the field. For exam-\nple, instrument calibration to obtain CCS values using pep-\ntide ions in lipid analyses have been shown to introduce\nsignificant error [44\u201346].\nMany advantages and disadvantages of TWIMS are also\nshared with DTIMS, such as the pulsed ion packet delivery by\nion gating and comprehensive analyte detection. Two key\nadvantages of TWIMS are (1) low voltage requirements due\nto constant wave heights and (2) the ability to manipulate ion\nmotion into long path length separations without significant ion\nloss. These long path length structures effectively enhance\nmobility separation by increasing the number of interactions\nbetween the analyte and drift gas [47]. The low voltage re-\nquirement for TWIMS has been essential in the design of two\nextremely long path length platforms (e.g., tens to hundreds of\nmeters in length): the circular IMS device recently released by\nWaters Corporation [48] and the Structures for Lossless Ion\nManipulations (SLIM) platform currently undergoing develop-\nment in the Smith group at Pacific Northwest National Labo-"

Molecular graphs are a common graph-based\nrepresentation used for chemistry, where the edges represent\nbonds, and nodes represent atoms. Beyond identifiers, nodes\nand edges can contain other forms of numeric information\nsuch as distances between atoms being stored in edges. To\nhandle and leverage inputs in the form of graphs, many graph-\nbased networks (Figure 3e) have been developed. Graph\nneural networks (GNNs) operate on graphs and modify their\nrepresentations based on predictions. In turn, GNNs will often\nhave their property embeddings pooled and summed for\npredictions performed by other ANN layers. Various other\ntypes of graph-based neural networks have been developed,\nwith a notable example being graph convolutional networks\n(GCNs).

        "The figure suggests that the Type I error rate depends more upon the algorithm followed in\ntesting slopes than the \u03b1-level used for the tests. Forward-stepping approaches that tested the\ntwo random slopes in an arbitrary sequence performed poorly in terms of Type I error even\nat relatively high \u03b1 levels. This was especially the case for the smaller, 12-item sets, where\nthere was less power to detect by-item random slope variance. In contrast, performance was\nrelatively sound for backward models even at relatively low \u03b1 levels, as well as for the \u201cbest\npath\u201d models regardless of whether the direction was backward or forward. It is notable that\nthese sounder data-driven approaches showed only small gains in power over maximal\nmodels (indicated by the dashed line in the background of the figure).\nFrom the point of view of overall Type I error rate, we can rank the analyses for both within-\nand between-items designs in order of desirability:\n8This anticonservativity stems from underestimation of the variation between subjects and/or items, as is suggested by generally better\nperformance of the maximal model in the 24- as opposed to 12-item simulations. In the appendix, we show that as additional subjects\nand items are added, the Type I error rate for LMEMs with random slopes decreases rapidly, while for random-intercepts-only models,\nit actually increases.\nBarr et al.\nPage 18\nJ Mem Lang.

Bilinear and bicubic methods have traditionally been\nutilized in MSI to improve the visual continuity of images,\nwhile other methods have emerged more recently.40 Nearest\nneighbor interpolation simply adopts the intensity of the\nnearest pixel.41 Bilinear uses the 4 surrounding points (2 \u00d7 2)\nfor linear interpolation, while bicubic uses the surrounding 16\npoints (4\u00d7) for nonlinear interpolation.40 Of the four\napproaches, Lanczos is the slowest, but provides the highest\nresolution images, with a more sophisticated sinc function,\nintended to preserve details while minimizing artifacts.41 For\nthe purposes of the work described herein, the bicubic\nalgorithm was applied.\nFollowing, affine transformation was applied. MSIght\nincludes functionality for landmark-based affine transformation\nas well as an automated approach. For manual affine\nregistration, four corresponding coordinates were selected\nfrom each the H&E image and the interpolated MSI image.\nAffine registration was performed by the OpenCV package. For\nautomated affine registration, both images were first overlaid\nwith all pixel coordinates matching. Then, the phase cross-\ncorrelation was calculated using Sci-kit Image. The registration\nmatrix was iteratively evaluated to minimize the sum of\nsquared difference (SSD). The affine registered image then\nunderwent nonlinear B-spline registration using SimpleITK."

The capacity of the approach is demon-\nstrated in Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3, showing a high\ncorrelation between the WGA stain (Fig. 1A) and the t-MALDI-2-\nMSI data recorded from a Vero-B4 monoculture at a pixel size of\n2 \u03bcm (Fig. 1B).\nFurthermore, histological images based on Hoechst and\nWGA stains enabled a segmentation of the data into back-\nground and areas associated with individual cells (see Materials\nand Methods for details). This segmentation is displayed using\noutlines around each cell in Fig. 1C overlaid with with the\nmass spectrometric data, again demonstrating the high \ufb01delity\nof coregistration. The combination of coregistration and seg-\nmentation now enables applying the work\ufb02ow for single-cell\ndata extraction and further processing, as visualized in Fig. 2.

This difference in scale\noccurs for a simple reason: A smaller batch size results in more weight updates per epoch than a\nlarge batch size, and so the shrinking effect of weight decay (which imposes a penalty on the norm of\nthe weights) is more pronounced. The evolution of the weight norms during training is depicted in\nFigure 2(b) and (e). Figure 2 is not visualizing the endogenous sharpness of minimizers, but rather\njust the (irrelevant) weight scaling. The scaling of weights in these networks is irrelevant because\nbatch normalization re-scales the outputs to have unit variance. However, small weights still appear\nmore sensitive to perturbations, and produce sharper looking minimizers.\nFilter Normalized Plots\nWe repeat the experiment in Figure 2, but this time we plot the loss\nfunction near each minimizer separately using random \ufb01lter-normalized directions.

Certain injuries often result in development of \nPTOA, including joint impact loading; anterior cruci-\nate ligament (ACL); meniscal, ligament, or joint capsule \ntears and injuries; joint dislocations; and recurrent joint \ninstability [10\u201312, 15, 26, 46]. One of the major risk factors \nfor the development of PTOA is damage to the chondral \nsurface during injury, which is related to the injury sever-\nity [11, 13, 23, 26]. In intra-articular fractures, the under-\nlying subchondral bone is also affected, which increases \nthe risk of PTOA development [11, 13, 15, 56]. The sever-\nity of the injury depends on the magnitude, orientation, \nand rate of the applied force and determines the absorbed \nenergy and mechanical damage to cartilage and the sur-\nrounding structures [9, 12, 16, 24, 47]. The injury results in \nchondrocyte death and ECM damage, which contributes \nto cartilage loss [13, 16, 26, 47]. Nevertheless, Zhang et\u00a0al. \nsuggested that chondrocyte catabolism instead of death \nresults in cartilage degeneration, although the chon-\ndrocytes eventually will die [48]. Although mechanical \ntrauma is a major risk factor, it is insufficient to explain all \nthe changes in the cartilage in the unaffected areas [15, 16]. \nTherefore, the severity of the injury is not the only factor"

To estimate these forces during our single chosen iteration of MNIST, for\neach neighbor j, we randomly selected 5 dik values among dik\u2019s distribution and visualized\ntheir resulting attractive forces for i\u2019s neighbor j. In Figure 12b, we visualize the results of\n10 draws of the dik\u2019s. This \ufb01gure directly shows that Principles 4 and 6 seem to be obeyed.\nLet us move on to the forces on k. For each further point k in a triplet, its contribution\nto TriMap\u2019s loss depends on dij where j is the neighbor in that triplet:\nLossik =\n\u02dcdij\n\u02dcdij + \u02dcdik\n=\nd2\nij + 1\nd2\nij + d2\nik + 2.\nAgain let us view dij as a \ufb01xed number for this moment during training. Note from Figure 12a\nthat dij takes values mainly from 0 to 3, which means the set of values 0.3, 1, 2, and 3 are\nrepresentative of the typical dij values we would see in practice. We visualize the repulsive\nforces received by k corresponding to these 4 typical values of dij, shown in Figure 12c.

In small samples, where normality is an \nimportant assumption, tests for normality do not have \nmuch power, while for larger samples, where deviation \nof normality is no longer an obstacle to use a t-test, the \ntests for normality will often be statistically significant. \nThe test for normality will therefore often suggest to use \nthe wrong test.

        "expressed in the stained image (Fig. 2b). The innermost\nlayer of the mucosa is composed of the bladder epithelium\n(urothelium), indicated by the phosphatidylcholine species\nPC (34:1) at m/z 798.5410 (Fig. 2a, green). This discussion\nshows that our MS imaging method can reproduce very\ndetailed histological features, close to cellular resolution.\nIn addition, it also provides highly reliable molecular\ninformation.\nA mass spectrum acquired from a single 10-lm pixel\nfrom the urinary bladder imaging experiments is shown in\nFig. 2c. Several peaks are labeled based on accurate mass\nmeasurements. Mass deviation of assigned peaks in this\nspectrum was below or equal to 1 ppm. Mass accuracy as\ndetermined over the whole measurement (10965 spectra)\nwas 0.6 ppm (root mean square of all mass deviations) for\nPC (34:1) at m/z 798.5410. This demonstrates that accurate\nmass detection is stable over the whole measurement under\nimaging conditions. This is a prerequisite for reliable\nidenti\ufb01cation of compounds and for speci\ufb01c image gener-\nation. Another important factor that in\ufb02uences MS image\nquality is mass resolution. The effect of different bin\nwidths used for image generation is discussed in detail in\nRo\u00a8mpp et al. (2010a), (Figure S5).

        "Associate Editor: Hanchuan Peng\nAbstract\nSummary: Joint analysis of mass spectrometry images (MS images) and microscopy images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissues \nassists pathologists in characterizing the morphological structure of the tissues, and in performing diagnosis. Unfortunately, the analysis is \nundermined by substantial differences between these modalities in terms of aspect ratios, spatial resolution, number of channels in each im\u00ad\nage, as well as by large global or small local elastic spatial deformations of one image with respect to the other. Therefore, accurate coregistra\u00ad\ntion of the images is a critical pre-requisite for their joint interpretation. We introduce MSIreg, an open-source R package for coregistration of \nMSI and H&E images. MSIreg is designed for high-dimensional MSI experiments where each spatial location is represented by thousands of \nmass features. Unlike most existing coregistration methods, MSIreg implements a landmark free workflow, and quantitative metrics for perfor\u00ad\nmance evaluation. We evaluate the performance of MSIreg on six case studies, including coregistration of contiguous tissues with large defor\u00ad\nmations, as well as simultaneous coregistration of 29 tissue microarray cores.\nAvailability and implementation: The R package, installation instructions, and fully reproducible vignettes describing methods and Case \nStudies are available open-source under the GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/sslakkimsetty/msireg/."

The second data set is a combination of a sensory and a\nconsumer study and has the name carrots.\n4.1. The TVbo data\nThe main purpose in this study was to assess 12 products, speci\ufb01ed by two features: Picture,\na factor with 4 levels and TVset, a factor with 3 levels.

Figure 4 compares the performance of spatial-DGMM\nto that of GMM on Simulated Data 1 (For comparison of spatial-\nDGMM and GMM on experimental data in section 4.4 and 4.5,\nSupplementary Figs.

With low noise, both GMM and\nspatial-DGMM suggest the correct number of morphological com-\nponents (K \u00bc K0 \u00bc 3), have low estimation errors, and low mis-\nclassification rates.\nAs the noise increases, the component map derived by GMM\nbecomes uncertain, and the estimation error and the misclassifica-\ntion rate rapidly increase. Spatial-DGMM, on the other hand, lever-\nages the information from the neighboring locations, has a lower\nestimation and misclassification error. In this particular simulation\nthe 1.5-fold change between the mean intensities of the components\nis obscured when the noise exceeds 20%.

Since \nthe case R\u2009=\u20090 is very uncommon in practical HDD appli-\ncations, the FDR can be roughly thought of as the pro-\nportion of false positives among declared positives (i.e., \namong rejected tests). Controlling FDR is less stringent \nthan controlling FWER, as FDR control inherently allows \nfor some false positives. The goal of FDR control is to \nidentify as many positive test results as possible, while \naccepting a relatively low proportion of false discover-\nies. In practice, common choices for FDR control are 5 \nor 10%.\nThe Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure [108] is the \nmost widely used method for controlling the FDR. It \nis described in Table\u00a019. Notably, the adjusted thresh-\nold value used by the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method \nis identical to that used by the Bonferroni and Holm \nmethods for the variable with the smallest p-value, \nbut it is much larger for the others. It is generally true \nthat lists of discoveries generated by procedures that \ncontrol the FDR are much longer than those gener-\nated by methods that control the FWER at the same \nlevel. Yet, like the Bonferroni method, the original \nFDR method is conservative, effectively controlling \nthe FDR at level \u03b1\u00b7m0/m\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b1 if the variables are inde-\npendent.

As the labeling of acetyl-CoA is dependent\non the activity of multiple pathways upstream of acetyl-CoA, we\ntherefore cannot know or assume a single acetyl-CoA labeling pattern\nfor use with the standard ISA approach. As an alternative, we devel-\noped a modi\ufb01ed version of ISA that we refer to as SISA. Instead of\ninferring D from \ufb01xed tracer labeling, we infer the isotopic labeling of\nthe entire monomer pool directly along with g(t) at each pixel. Thus,"

This pipeline consists in several steps\nwhich are listed in ESM, Protocol S1.\nMSI of breast cancer tissue\nMSI of lipids was performed on a fresh-frozen breast cancer\ntissue section, which was mounted onto an LMD-compatible\nmembrane slide to be able to use the same section for MSI and\nLMD. We used a high-pressure MALDI mass spectrometer,\nwhich leaves most of the membrane unaffected and therefore\nusable by an LMD system. Three co-registration steps had to\nbe performed to couple the obtained MSI data to the LMD\nsystem (Fig. 1).\nCo-registration of MSI and LMD\nThe first step consisted of co-registering the MSI data to the\nhigh-resolution optical image of the tissue with matrix (Fig.\n1(I)). To be most accurate and overcome limitations in vendor-\nshipped software, this was achieved by directly matching the\ncoordinates of three manually selected MSI pixels with their\nFig. 1 Co-registration steps from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to\nlaser microdissection (LMD). Several co-registration steps are needed in\norder to transfer spatial information from MSI to the LMD system (orange\narrows).

The statistical measures, such as precision (0.99), accuracy (0.98), and concordance (0.97), remain very high even after changing eosin levels, showing that the DAB quantification is stable and robust.",

        "0.99.  \nWhen hematoxylin and eosin both were added to the DAB stained slides, no difference in \nslope was observed, (p=0.281) but a significant mean-shift (p<0.001) was seen (figure 2). \nThis indicates a difference in level, but no interaction of stains that would change the rate \nof quantification of DAB. Although after addition of eosin a significant mean-shift to \nhigher IOD values was observed, the scale-factor was 0.95. Because of the high precision \n(0.99) and the high accuracy (0.98) the resulting concordance (0.97) still was high.  \nTo further study the influence of the eosin staining on the DAB quantification, we also \nmeasured the DAB IOD with different levels of eosin counterstain. Eosin staining was \nadded, or \u2018bleached\u2019 by incubating the slides in 95% alcohol or distilled water, until \nappreciable reduction in the eosin staining was observed. This way, eosin concentration \nwas increased and reduced to about 75% and 40% of the initial concentration. There were \nno significant differences in slope (p=0.738) or mean (p=0.193) of the DAB \nquantifications, indicating that the three eosin levels did not significantly interfere with \nthe DAB quantification (figure 3). Even after these multiple rounds of processing, the \nDAB measurements showed precision, accuracy and concordance of more than 0.99, with \nmean-shifts of less than 0.1, and scale-factors of 0.98-1.00.

Notwith-\nstanding, there are two notable barriers that limit interpretation of\nmetabolite and lipid pool sizes as assessed by MSI. First, changes in\nthe relative abundance of a compound are dif\ufb01cult to determine\nbetween different regions of a tissue section. Among the quantita-\ntive challenges is that, unlike LC/MS, MSI simultaneously subjects all\nof the molecules within a particular tissue location to the ionization\nprocess without any prefractionation5. Given that the abundance of\nother molecules in a sample can in\ufb02uence the ionization ef\ufb01ciency\nof the target analyte, changes in MSI signal intensity between tissue\nregions do not necessarily correspond to changes in the actual\nconcentration of the target analyte6. This is particularly a concern\nwhen comparing sample regions of diverse composition, such as\ntumor and healthy tissue, where a large number of molecular dif-\nferences may contribute to variable matrix effects. The second\nlimitation of pool size-based MSI studies is that metabolite abun-\ndances do not fully capture the dynamics of metabolism7.

If\n\u03b5k = 0, (2) boils down to a common, deterministic gradi-\nent descent method. The approximation of g is realised by\ncomputing g using not all voxels, but only a small subset of\nvoxels, randomly selected in every iteration. In this way, the\ncomputational costs per iteration are greatly reduced, while\nconvergence properties are still similar to those obtained by\ndeterministic gradient descent. The scalar gain factor \u03b3k, the\n\u201cstep size\u201d, is determined by a prede\ufb01ned decaying function\nof the iteration number k. An often used choice is:\n\u03b3k \u2261\u03b3 (k) = a/(k + A)\u03b1,\n(4)\nwith user-speci\ufb01ed constants a > 0, A \u22651, and 0 < \u03b1 \u22641.\nA choice of \u03b1 = 1 gives a theoretically optimum rate of con-\nvergence when k \u2192\u221e(Kushner and Yin 2003). In practice,\nthe algorithm is stopped after a speci\ufb01ed maximum num-\nber of iterations, and, therefore, it sometimes makes sense\nto choose \u03b1 < 1, which causes the step size to decay less\nfast. The need for setting a, A, and \u03b1 complicates the usage\nof RM for image registration. The factor a is especially dif-\n\ufb01cult, since it has no unit, and heavily depends on the choice\nof the cost function. For example, when we multiply C by an\narbitrary constant c, the value of a would need to be divided\nby c in order to get the same sequence {\u03bck}. When a is set\ntoo small, the RM method suffers from slow convergence."

It can\ntherefore provide valuable information not accessible through histopathology or other\nimaging modalities [1\u20134]. MS images are typically represented as high-dimensional\nimages of shape Rows x Columns x N, where N is the number of molecular mea-\nsurements per point (also referred to as MS spectra). Each pixel in the image has\nan associated mass/charge (m/z) spectrum with N values. If an m/z measurement\ndoes not align perfectly with a predefined bin, its intensity is typically summed into\nthe closest bin. Mapping from N to 1 or 3 dimensions is needed to visualize these\nhigh-dimensional images for humans.\nNext, we give a short overview of existing software for MSI and previous compu-\ntational visualization methods applied for MSI, before describing the MSI-VISUAL\nframework and the proposed new visualizations.\n1.2 Previous software for MSI analysis\nThe Cardinal [5] and SCiLS Lab (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) are popular\nMSI analysis software.

Managing such large datasets requires effective\ndata reduction techniques that extract meaningful information\nPage 1 of 9\nBioinformatics\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025.

This procedure can be seen as a post hoc maximizing procedure that chooses a threshold 'a' to maximize rejections while satisfying a specific constraint. In the context of cell biology, the spatial distribution of cells within a clone can be analyzed using the probability of colocalization, denoted as p(dist(ci, cj) \u2264r|i, j \u2208Y), which can help identify clone-specific behaviors and stratifications. By comparing these values across different clonal populations, researchers can determine if certain cells tend to stay close or disperse intentionally.

(Some\nof the ideas of bootMer are adapted from merBoot (S\u00e1nchez-Espigares and Oca\u00f1a 2009), a\nmore ambitious framework for bootstrapping lme4 model \ufb01ts which unfortunately seems to\nbe unavailable at present.)\nConditional variances of random e\ufb00ects\nIt is useful to clarify that the conditional covariance concept in lme4 is based on a simpli\ufb01-\ncation of the linear mixed model.

The notebook snippet shown in\nFig. 8 describes this formulation and its implementation\nusing SimpleITK and the SciPy library [14]. With the\nthresholding-based approach, once the fiducial is segmented\nwe use SimpleITK\u2019s LabelShapeStatisticsImage\nFilter component to obtain its location as the centroid of\nthe segmented blob and its radius as the radius of the sphere\nwhich has the same volume as the segmented blob.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nTwo significant requirements associated with modern scien-\ntific computational environments are that they facilitate col-\nlaborations and that they enable reproducibility [1, 2, 7, 21].\nIn this work, we presented such an environment for devel-\noping biomedical image analysis workflows using a literate\nprogramming approach with the Python or R programming\nlanguages.
